The script, `style.php`, is a wrapper to the lessphp compiler, enabling autocompiling of LESS-files to a CSS-file and utilizing gzip and browser caching together with easy access to configuration options through a config-file.

`style.php` makes it easier for advanced use of server-side compiling of `style.less` to `style.css`.
